Solar On Grid System

What is a Solar on grid system?

A grid-tied solar system lets you power your home with the sun while staying connected to the local grid. You can draw electricity from the grid when solar isn’t enough, and send any extra you produce back for credits through net metering—though the exact benefits depend on your state’s policy.

On-Grid Solar Systems – How They Work & Why They’re Beneficial

How It Works

•	Panels – Capture sunlight → produce DC electricity.
•	Inverter – Converts DC → AC power for home use.
•	Electrical Panel – Distributes AC power through the building.
•	Net Metering – Sends extra power to the grid for credits (varies by state).
•	Grid Backup – Draws electricity from the grid when solar isn’t enough.

Key Advantages

•	No Batteries Needed – Grid acts as a virtual battery, saving storage costs.
•	Earn Through Net Metering – Sell surplus energy for financial credits.
•	Consistent Supply – Reliable power, even on cloudy days.
•	Lower Installation Cost – No battery = smaller upfront investment.
•	Eco-Friendly – Reduces fossil fuel reliance, cutting carbon footprint.

 


Off-Grid Solar Systems 

What is a Solar Off grid system?

An off-grid solar system operates completely independently from the utility grid. It uses solar panels to generate electricity and batteries to store it for later use, making it ideal for remote areas or places with unreliable grid access.


Off-Grid Solar Systems – How They Work & Why They’re Beneficial

How it works

•	Solar Panels – Capture sunlight → produce DC electricity.
•	Charge Controller – Regulates power and sends it to the batteries.
•	Battery Bank – Stores energy for night-time or cloudy days.
•	Inverter – Converts stored DC into AC for household use.
•	Distribution Panel – Sends AC power to appliances and devices.
•	Backup Options – Extra storage or generators can support high-demand periods.



Key Advantages

•	Independent Power – No reliance on the utility grid.
•	Ideal for Remote Areas – Works where grid access is costly or impossible.
•	No Monthly Bills – Eliminates recurring electricity costs.
•	Reliable in Outages – Continues supplying power during disasters or grid failures.



 



On-Grid vs Off-Grid Solar – Find Your Perfect Match

Choosing the right solar system isn’t just about going green—it’s about choosing the lifestyle that fits your needs. Here’s how they compare:

 On-Grid Solar – Smart & Cost-Efficient

•	Lower Upfront Cost – No expensive batteries required.
•	Slash Your Power Bills – Offset usage and earn credits through net metering (where available).
•	Perfect for City Living – Best for areas with reliable electricity.
•	Extra Earnings – Sell your unused power back to the grid.
•	Low Maintenance – Fewer parts to manage over time.

 Off-Grid Solar – Total Freedom & Energy Independence


•	Zero Electricity Bills – Complete independence from the utility grid.
•	Power Anytime, anywhere – Store your own electricity and use it during outages or at night.
•	Ideal for Remote Locations – Works where grid connection is costly or impossible.
•	Energy Security – Your power supply stays safe during blackouts or disasters.
•	Eco-Warrior Choice – 100% renewable energy, no fossil fuel dependency.


Choosing the Right Solar System for You


Before deciding between an on-grid or off-grid setup, think about:

•	 Location – Is the power grid in your area stable, or do outages happen often?
•	 Budget – Will you invest in battery backup, or stick to a simpler, lower-cost option?
•	 Usage – How much power do you need daily, and do you require 24/7 supply?
•	 Green Goals – Do you want full energy independence, or simply cut down on emissions?


Tip for the undecided: A hybrid solar system gives you both — grid access when you need it and battery storage for backup power.




What is a Hybrid Solar System?

A hybrid solar system blends the strengths of on-grid and off-grid setups, giving you flexibility, backup power, and savings in one package. It generates electricity from solar panels, stores extra energy in batteries, and stays connected to the local grid for additional support.
With this setup, you can keep the lights on during outages, use stored power when needed, and even earn credits by sending surplus electricity to the grid (net metering policies vary by state).

Perfect for:  Homes or businesses that want energy independence, reliable backup, and the option to use the grid when necessary.

Frequently Asked Questions


Q: What's the difference between on-grid, off-grid, and hybrid solar systems in Karnataka? 
A: On-grid systems connect to BESCOM/MESCOM/HESCOM/GESCOM grids and don't need batteries. Off-grid systems work independently with battery storage - ideal for rural Karnataka areas. Hybrid systems combine both - they have batteries for backup but stay connected to the grid for extra support.


Q: What solar subsidies are available in Karnataka in 2025? A: Karnataka residents can get Central Financial Assistance (CFA) under the PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana. While Karnataka doesn't provide separate state subsidies, the central scheme offers significant support for residential rooftop solar installations.


Q: How does net metering work with BESCOM and other ESCOMs in Karnataka? 
A: Karnataka has implemented net metering under the Karnataka Renewable Energy Policy 2022-27, allowing grid-connected rooftop solar PV projects. KERC has framed SRTPV Regulations, 2016 for implementation.


Q: Do I need any special permits for solar installation in Karnataka? 
A: For rooftop solar up to certain capacity, minimal permissions are required. Your installer will handle BESCOM/ESCOM approvals and net metering applications


Q: What is net metering and how does it work in Karnataka? A: Net metering is a billing system where your solar panels feed excess electricity back to the grid, and you receive credits for this power. In Karnataka, when your solar system produces more electricity than you consume, the surplus goes to the grid through a bidirectional meter. During times when you need more power than your panels produce (like at night), you draw from the grid. At the end of the billing cycle, you only pay for the net electricity consumed.
